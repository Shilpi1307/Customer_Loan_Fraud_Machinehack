# Predicting Customer Loan Default
Predicting Customer Loan Default
# Introduction
In today's financial landscape, an accurate prediction of customer loan default can reduce the risk and maintain a healthy lending portfolio
So in this challenge we have to develop machine learning models to determine the likelihood of a customer defaulting on a loan.
We have two Dataset Train and test<br>
**Shape  of train** :1,106,674,62<br> 
**Shape of test dataset:** 474,289,60

**#Technologies and libraries used**
The contents of this repository were created and implemented in Colab notebooks & jupyter notebook. The following libraries were majorily used:<br>
1.Pandas<br>
2.numpy<br>
3.Statistics<br>
4.scikit-learn<br>
